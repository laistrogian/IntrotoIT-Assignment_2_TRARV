                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Hello there, I'm Artem Chesnokov S3722286 You can contact me at artyomchesnokov@gmail.com
<br>
<br>I was born in Russian Federation back in 1999. In 2008 I have immigrated to Australia with my family. Since then I've graduated from Werribee Secondary College last year and am currently studying at RMIT to become a bachelor of Information Technology. I speak both Russian and English fluently. I also have a whopping 540 hours on the Pyro class in Team Fortress 2 and have led a competitive team for nearly two years.
<br>
<br>My interest in IT is based mostly on a desire to be able to use the tools technology provides, instead of having to rely on subpar implementations made by someone else I would like to make my own. I've always been around technology but my interest in IT started when I was building a PC. At some point when making part lists I wondered "How does any of this hardware work?". Previously I did messed around with basic modding and I've created a custom script or two for TF2. I chose to study at RMIT because it was one of the best universities for more technical subjects while also being the closest one so it was simply the perfect uni. I expect to learn how to program on an intermediate level. I also expect to learn the fundamentals of how computer hardware works</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Hello, my name is Timothy Shen, my student number is s3721278 and my email is s3721278@student.rmit.edu.au. I was was born in Melbourne Australia. My ethnicity is chinese, but the main language I speak is english. I can speak very little mandarin. I studied and completed Primary and Secondary school and now i'm here studying at RMIT as a first year doing a Bachelor of Information Technology. I have two dogs. As for hobbies i'm not very interested in sports, however I do occasionally watch a bit of esports. I enjoy walking my dogs, playing videogames, sleeping and sleeping some more.
<br>
<br>My interest in computers, technology and IT began when i was pretty young. I would watch my older brother play computer games which sparked my interest. As I got older and began using a computer I found it cool how you could play an infinite amount of games, google basically anything, watch other peoples videos via youtube and purchase and sell items online. I studied IT in year 11, but none of the stuff we learned has any relevance here. I don't have any experience in coding or programming.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Hello my name is Roland and i am currently a first year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I am studying a bachelor of technology ( Computer Studies) and i have a passion for working with A.I., building websites, programming, musical production and football (soccer). My student number is s3724076 at RMIT and my email address is s3724076@student.rmit.edu.au and my personal email is rolstar99@gmail.com. I have three pets, one dog and two cats and I recently arrived in Melbourne from a small farm located in northern NSW. I have been overseas a few times to countries such as Fiji, South Korea, Italy and England twice. The only language I speak fluently is English, though I know a little Latin and Italian.
<br>
<br>My interest in IT was sparked when I was 13 in my first year of high school, when I was introduced into the world of game-making by a friend of my father's. Before then, I immersed myself in creativity-orientated activities, such as drawing, writing, making board games. It is from those chapters in my life that I generated within myself a thirst to create. I gradually abandoned game development when i was about 16, after realising the overwhelming competition in which I would without a doubt fail in making myself stand out.
<br>
<br>I was introduced to IT around the same time by my father, who had worked in IT. I took a distance education course in IT when I was 17/18 which I approached passionately, and took work experience in a small, local IT company. I love to immerse myself in technology and am constantly fascinated by its achievements. Since then, I am and have been constantly seeking new methods to harness my creative aspect into the world of IT. My personal obsession with IT is very much focused on creatively approaching issues.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>Throughout most of my life I have had a passion for computers.I learned how to handle computer programming in primary school I remember being fascinated by this machine that seemingly worked by magic. I was the only the one who could solve error codes in computer in my family members long time ago. For me, the most attractive aspect of technology is problem solving. There’s always a logical reason why computers do what they do, and diagnosing problems is both fun and rewarding to me. Also I have a strong interest in IT products.  I have used various game consoles, gaming laptops, gaming mouse and a headsets.  I have chosen RMIT for my belief that my passion about IT should be more enhanced for my career. Even though there is an unfortunate perception that a career in tech is not a typical choice for a woman. I expect to learn professional programming skills as I am still struggling to utilize Java program and making other computer code. I will need more acknowledge to improve my programming skills.</p>

<br>
<br>I was born and raised in Indonesia which means I could speak Indonesian language along with English as my second language. I moved to USA to further my study, spending two years in Seattle and another two in Minneapolis before moving to Melbourne for my study in RMIT. Other than my passion about IT and technology in general, I am someone who enjoy watching sports. Whether it is soccer, american football, basketball, tennis or Formula 1, watching competitions is one of my hobby. &nbsp;<br><br>My interest in IT has always been about one thing: How the technology can help our daily lives, beyond being a collection of devices used for the sake of entertainment &amp; leisure. The technological advancements in last decade or so have allowed us to create powerful devices in a smaller footprint and they started coming into the appliances and devices that we've never thought would be possible. Creating these smart devices that are connected to each other through the internet allows us to control and manage the devices remotely and with the help of data analysis and artifical intelligence, we have even started creating devices that does not need to be setup and learn user's behaviour on their own.<br></p>

Java, C, &nbsp;Phyton, SQL, and PHP are among the most used programming language and database and people who are working in IT are typically expected to be familiar or to be expert with these languages. Some other IT skills such as Windows Server and Circuit Simulator are more job specific for people who are doing harware development or system administration.<br><br>For general skills, communication has always been one of the most important aspect for an employee to have, especially with IT projects now require people to work in group. Ability to create an accurate and concise technical writing is also extremely important as in general the manager and executives are not completely aware about all the details of the project. Project management can be a very useable skill as the employee gains more experience, he / she would gain responsibility in leading a team.&nbsp;</div><br><div>Here are the top skills required that are not on our list:</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">IT Skills: Javascript, SAP, Business Management, Business Analysis, Graphic Design</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">General Skills: Problem Solving, Organizational skill, Planning, Creativity, Time Management</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">After looking the burning glass data, one of the surpises would be the general demand for Infrastructure Architect and System Analysis which tops the list considering how programmer is one of the most talked career with one the highest job growth rate in recent years.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div></div>

As all the projects I work on require only one developer to be across the whole project, from design to implementation, there is no other developers or development team that needs to be managed. The only IT professionals I need to be regular contact and require good working relationships with are the T support team who manage the servers (where my web applications reside) and the databases.

It is important to outline to clients the rich possibilities that IT can provide but also be careful not to over promise. I am more interested in producing a stable system and gets delivered on time than with stringing out work (and pay) – by not managing client expectations I risk the project residing  in “DEV Hell” if System Requirements change and the project lags in Design time.
<br> 
<br>The second challenging aspect of my role is the ever compromise between good design and good implementation. Modern tools take a lot of the boring repetition of coding away so more time can be spent on designing the system. A perfect design however, is never possible and to produce a system that works well invariably requires compromise. Getting that compromise between good design and code and a working product is most challenging.&nbsp;<br></p>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>What does it do? (600 words) ​What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible? 
</strong><br><strong><br></strong><div>
</div><div>It is difficult to say exactly what is the state of the art of cryptocurrencies as the technology acts as more of a platform which is built on top of in different ways and directions by each currency. For example the original currency which invented blockchains; Bitcoin is still considered by many to be the best of the bunch due to its robustness, large amount of specialised mining ASICS that secure the network and the ecosystem surrounding it. While other currencies achieved success by improving on the basic cryptocurrency mould. For example Etherium added advanced functionality which allows users to code “smart contracts” which are executed on it’s blockchain while its mining algorithm favours graphics cards. Or in case of Monero it allows users to perform fully private transactions unlike Bitcoin where all transactions are traceable while it’s mining algorithm prefers CPUs. 
</div><div>Today a user can actually own their money by being their own bank. A blockchain allows a currency to exist and function without being controlled by a government an individual or company instead users agree on the rules which are then supported by miners who invest a large amount of money in ASICs which produce them money, this is the main difference between blockchains and other decentralised projects; those who secure the network are incentivized to continue to secure it and are punished by the network if they try to undermine it. Using Bitcoin and a BIP39 mnemonic anyone can escape persecution or a war torn country with all of their wealth just by storing 12 basic words in their head. Anyone can transmit any amount of money to anyone in the world for an under 1 cent transaction fee with BCH just by knowing the recipients wallet address. With Ethereum anyone can create their own tokens and or cryptocurrencies on top the ETH blockchain. Using something like memo.cash anyone can store information on the BCH blockchain and even have conversations with other users without the fear of being censored or their comments being removed. In the next three years some currencies will see increased usage and acceptance as payments for goods and services, most likely a very streamlined and or user friendly currency or application will popularise the technology by reducing the difficulty of using cryptocurrencies for the average layperson. A cryptocurrency will either be created or improved upon to match or exceed the benefits of using physical money while having a minimal amount of drawbacks and resources needed to maintain it. 
</div><div>There are two major technologies that allow cryptocurrencies to function. The internet is of course required as without it the blockchain would not be able to be accessed by anyone outside the local network, this would greatly impact the utility of the blockchain. The second is Proof of Work(PoW) which uses cryptography to verify that a user spent time finding a hash which allows them to create a valid block, this is hugely important as without having proof that someone spent clock cycles and electricity on securing the network would mean that the network is only as secure as long as every participant is honest.
</div><br><div><br></div><div><strong>What is the likely impact? (300 words) ​What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? 
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>The potential impacts of cryptocurrencies will be and are massive. People will start to use cryptocurrencies to do things that were impossible or just uneconomical such as overseas money transfers or fully secured and automated trades or bets. The financial sector especially will be impacted as cryptocurrencies will change how money can flows in the world. The people who should be the most affected by this technology are the poor who  are currently not served by a bank. In less developed countries without a stable national currency or a strong banking system currently suffer without financial security, cryptocurrencies will allow them to maintain and secure their wealth especially in time of crisis. The banking systems in developed countries will also be affected due to people having the option to entirely bypass them when storing and or sending their money. Cryptocurrencies will both create and make many jobs redundant. If cryptocurrencies succeed in replacing a significant chunk of the financial system then two things will happen: A large amount of software based jobs and startups will be created to build on top of existing blockchains and to provide blockchain based services and products, as well as hardware sided jobs and companies which will fulfill the demand for miners and other utilities such as hardware wallets. However a large amount of jobs will become redundant such as some security services, many banking related jobs and perhaps even casino workers and stock brokers.
</div><br><div><br></div><div><strong>How will this affect you? (300 words) ​In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends? 
</strong></div><br><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>I would most likely never get a bank account as I’d be able to store and send my money with cryptocurrencies. For example if I wanted to buy something from the US amazon site I could pay for a product directly with a cryptocurrency for a &lt;1 cent fee, while if I wanted to do the same thing traditionally I would have to pay a fee to transfer money to my paypal account, then another fee to change my AUD to USD and then I would pay a defacto fee of 3% which is reflected in the price due to the merchant having to pay a 3% fee to paypal. I would most likely participate in some kind of a decentralised social network instead of the current social networks that are controlled by one company. I would contribute to open source blockchain applications and perhaps even build some of them perhaps as my job. Blockchain applications will affect my family and friends as such technology will reverse the trend of the internet centralizing under companies, these people would most likely participate in distributed services, applications and or networks instead of current traditional services that are built and managed by a few people, groups or companies. The way they transact on the internet and in person would also most likely change with internet payments perhaps being completely replaced with cryptocurrency transactions.

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>What does it do?
</strong><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Autonomous vehicles/driverless cars/self-driving cars do exactly what is stated in its name. They drive themselves without the need of human contact and are able to sense their surroundings carefully manoeuvring to avoid any crashes improving safety and efficiency. Currently in 2018 driverless cars are being tested not only in facilities but are being introduced to Australian roads around urban areas coming into contact with pedestrians and other vehicles too, and although it can be dangerous not fully knowing how a car will react with a specific scenario, it is a necessity to test them on real roads to ensure they can operate safely in the future. Although driverless cars are already being operable, they are still not 100% safe as proved by the tragic event when a self-driving uber hit a pedestrian crossing the road late at night in the US. The autonomous vehicle industry took some setbacks from the incident. Technological developments that make driverless cars possible are radar and camera sensors that collect data about the vehicles environment, however it’s the software in the onboard computer that decides what action the vehicle should perform, and because each company uses different software, some software perform better than others making them more safe and reliable. With the implementation of driverless cars in the coming years, we can expect to see them on our road, driving passengers to their destination, and with new technological advances in the future driverless cars will be improved with newer software to ensure they are as safe as possible, eliminating any chance of a fatal error resulting in death. The more testing that is done the more data companies will be able to gather about how vehicles react to different situations and environments, how and why their decisions are made and compare them to how a human would react. Data which can be used to improve driverless vehicles. In the near future it is highly likely that we will see driverless cars commuting everywhere.&nbsp;</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>What is the likely impact?
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>The coming of driverless vehicles will change the world in so many ways. The potential impact will be enormous. People will no longer even need to learn how to drive, uber/taxi/bus drivers will become redundant as the vehicles will be driving themselves. Mail and package delivery workers’ jobs will be much easier as they will only need to deliver packages and mail. Waste collectors will only need to press a button to pick up and put down the garbage bin. There will be less road accidents caused by humans, driving will be more efficient. More changes that may occur could be change in infrastructure to roads to make them more suitable for driverless cars. This could create new jobs that require software developers and hi-tech mechanic skills. Parents will no longer need to drive their children to school in the morning or to sports practice of extracurricular activities or events, thus however not everyone will have a self-driving car. There will be people who are sceptical of the idea of trusting their life to an autonomous vehicle and would rather be in control when they are in a car. This may cause issues where humans driving will make errors that autonomous  vehicles cannot anticipate and will not know how to react. Having both driverless vehicles and driver vehicles on the road may pose a danger. If people are given an option, there will always be those who will refuse to adapt and switch over.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">How will this affect you?&nbsp;</span></strong></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">For me personally, I wont need to learn how to drive or get my P’s anymore, which will save me a lot of time since I find driving to be tedious and boring, I wont need to rely on my parents/friends to drive me anywhere therefore I won’t need to bother them asking them to drive me to the shops, movies or arcade. With the implementation of driverless vehicles I could potentially drive to the city for class in the morning and sleep in the car for the duration of the ride or do something else productive like read a book. Furthermore when I go on long distance holidays with my family my parents wont need to take a rest every “X” hours which will make arriving to the destination take less time, meaning more time to enjoy the holiday. Having a car drive itself would mean smoother car rides, meaning my motion sickness would decrease or even disappear benefitting me. However I would also be extremely paranoid and nervous whenever I get into a self-driving car. I might not trust it for the first few months it is released to the public, because machines can always make errors and miscalculations. I would sceptical about it as it’s a huge jump in technological advancements, thus mistakes can easily occur, especially when the scale is this large. Driverless vehicles would affect me both positively and negatively.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>What does it do?
</strong><br><br><div>A Raspberry Pi is essentially a mini, affordable computer. It connects (optional) to a monitor/TV and functions as a regular computer. Unlike a regular PC, a Raspberry Pi can also be used for a multitude of purposes, including a robot controller, a stop motion or time lapse camera, a radio station, a web server, a security system and a home automation system. A Raspberry Pi as defined by its own website is “a credit-card-sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spread sheets, word processing, browsing the internet, and playing games.” Essentially, the Raspberry Pi is a more dynamic, affordable alternative to a specialised computer system. 
</div><div><br></div><div>The Raspberry Pi’s adaptability is demonstrated through its capability of running a variety of operating systems and software, and its physical capacity to harbour at least four USB ports, HDMI and Ethernet ports. It can also connect via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The physical model of the Raspberry Pi consists of a processor, a graphics chip, some RAM and the features previously mentioned. The model is around 8.5cm x 5.5cm and costs approximately $25 - $30, depending on the exact model. Upon purchase, the user has the option to purchase a variety of accessories, which include; a camera, an infrared camera, a specialised Raspberry Pi keyboard and a Gertboard, which is described as “…a Raspberry Pi Foundation sanctioned device, designed for educational purposes, that expands the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to allow interface with and control of LEDs, switches, analogue signals, sensors and other devices.”
</div><div><br></div><div>The website ‘Gizmodo’ claims that “Knowing what you can use the Pi for can help in understanding exactly what it is. This motion-sensing security camera, this Game Boy retro emulator, and this music player all use a Raspberry Pi with some extra bits and pieces bolted on top. We've previously covered a bunch of other Pi-inspired ideas on Field Guide which you can read up on,” they continue to add that: “As your technical prowess grows, the Pi is able to grow with you -- it can be used as the basis of projects that are more and more advanced if you want to get serious about your DIY computing. The GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins on the board let you hook up LED lights, motors, sensors, buttons and a host of other electronics quite easily.”
</div><div><br></div><div>While the extent of the Pi’s adaptability isn’t strictly limitless, it is worth noting that the device is capable of a wide variety of functions.  It has the potential to revolutionize the way society runs.
</div><div><br></div><div>To summarise, the Raspberry Pi is capable of infinite functions. It can be described as revolutionary technology through its capacity to serve a multitude of purposes. The Raspberry Pi is a pioneer in terms of usability. No other single piece of technology has had a similar degree of usability.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What is the likely impact?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The current impact of the Raspberry Pi is already revolutionary. The Raspberry Pi Foundation sold their 10 millionth computer back in September 2016. The foundation itself has described the Raspberry Pi’s impact as altering how the younger generations view computers by “filling the void that was left when computers became less like programmable machines and more like consumer products.” They also go on to report that their product is “used in classrooms, libraries, hackspaces, research laboratories, and within the industrial environment.” 
</div><div>In terms of education, the Raspberry Pi has allowed for significant development, particularly in the area of programming. Many governments from around the world have expressed their interest in integrating the Raspberry Pi technology into their existing school systems. This has allowed for the efficient teaching of programming skills and techniques to children, through programs like Scratch.
</div><div>The Raspberry Pi has also become popular for personal use. Its enhanced adaptability has made the Pi a game changer for home automation projects.
</div><div>This impact could be significantly magnified if the minicomputer had an increase in popularity.
</div><div>How will this affect you?
</div><div>Owning a Raspberry Pi could potentially increase the efficiency of my everyday life. I could implement any model as a security system, earthquake detector, media player, general computer or any other home automation project. The Raspberry Pi is capable of a role in every application of home automation and, ideally, should be used as such. The Raspberry has the potential to revolutionize our lives in ways we wouldn’t think possible previously. The Raspberry Pi is perfect example of changing technology. “The Pi can be used for other projects, too. Things like alarm clocks, media players and even a bot that tweets automatically can also be made. Also, its price of about $30 can make DIY projects a lot cheaper than buying pre-made retail products,”  reports the Burlington County Times, exemplifying its usefulness. 
</div><div>The Raspberry Pi is made for home automation projects. Its low cost, size, flexibility makes for an affordable, ideal alternative for DIY projects. In terms of accessibility, virtually anyone, regardless of wealth or IT knowledge, can work the Raspberry Pi into their personal home system in at least one instance.

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-7">The project consists of two elements, the Bluetooth sensor and the receiver. The sensor is planted a person’s neck, this is done without surgical aid. The sensor should be in the form of a small circle, roughly 1.5cm in diameter, 2mm thick. There, it will measure biometric data through contractions of muscle caused by the Golgi tendon organs and body temperature, speech vibrations and perspirations. The bio-signals associated with each emotion as previously defined by scientists allow the sensor to pick up exactly what emotions the patient is feeling. The receiver, in turn, will pick up the signals as transmitted by the Bluetooth sensor. Once the correct signals are acquired, the receiver matches the data with a database that allows the receiver to translate the signals into emotion. Once this is achieved, the receiver will make the appropriate decision to cater to the patients emotion, such as playing a song that fits the patient’s mood or connecting the patient with a help line without them having to do so.
<div>
</div><div>Beyond Blue states that ‘1 in 5 Australians experiences a mental health condition every year’ and that almost half the entire population (12,386,123 people) will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The Australian Bureau of Statistics states that ‘an average of 8 Australians take their life everyday…’, demonstrating the devastating and significant impact of depression on our society.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The Bureau also claims that 3 million Australians are currently living with depression and/or anxiety.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The consequences of mental health issues are well-known, and it is my conclusion that any project(s) that aim to combat mental health should be pursued in their entirety.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The sensor should be in the form of a small circle, roughly 1.5cm in diameter, 2mm thick and situated on the patient’s neck. It will measure biometric data through contractions of muscle caused by the Golgi tendon organs and body temperature, speech vibrations and perspirations. Indicators such as heartbeat can signify elements such as excitement or arousal, so it is important for the receiver, upon collecting the signals, to correctly differentiate between the alternatives. The perspiration of the patient can be collected by connecting two electrodes to the skin, which will test the patient’s conductivity, thereby indicating their level of perspiration. The sensor will also be able to pick up speech vibrations and be aware of when the subject is talking. The receiver will notice any irregularities and analyse whether the patient is calm/relaxed or nervous. The bio-signals associated with each emotion as previously defined by scientists allow the sensor to pick up exactly what emotions the patient is feeling. The receiver, in turn, will pick up the signals as transmitted by the Bluetooth sensor. Once the correct signals are acquired, the receiver matches the data with a database that allows the receiver to translate the signals into emotion. Once the emotion is determined, the receiver is obliged to respond accordingly. If the subject is feeling happy or in need of cheering up, the receiver will play a song, utilising the database to collect data on what genre/type of song is appropriate for the current mood. It is worth noting that the beats per minute (BPM) encoded within each audio file should exactly match either the patient’s current or desired heartbeat. The modulation of beats per minute within song generation was designed to mimic heartbeat, so finding a match should not be a problem. The receiver will also generate a smart playlist of similar songs. It is crucial that the receiver is notified of outside elements that will affect the patient’s mood (such as if the patient is a minor or if the sensor is not correctly positioned) and take it into account. If the patient’s current emotion is outstandingly negative, the receiver will respond accordingly, such as a phone call to mental health consultants/ help lines, recommendation for counselling, etc. The response should also connect the appropriate help line (i.e. Indigenous reserved help, teenager or elderly specific mental health consultants. The project is designed to recognise mental health rather than directly combat it, as a virtual mental health consultant might prove to be more harmful than useful. Comparatively, worst case scenarios of the proposed project and virtual mental health consultant differ in severity, the proposed project, at its worst, would cause a patient to be incorrectly recommended mental health consultant advice where it is not required. This scenario is easily overcome. Alternatively, the virtual mental health consultant, at its worst, could offer the wrong mental health maintenance strategies and potentially accelerate the patient’s illness.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The receiver should take the form as a piece of hardware, a small focused computer, which shouldn’t be too big, approximately a cube/box with 30cm x 30cm sides, capable of containing the databases used to match input. The receiver could be more affordably accomplished as software on a device such as a Raspberry Pi 3. The sensor should be in the form of a small circle, roughly 1.5cm in diameter, 2mm thick. Technology similar to the Moodmetric Ring and improved sensors found on many monitoring devices such as the Apple Watch in cohesion with biometric data collection methods are required to put the project into motion.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>A detailed understanding of Bluetooth, audio, mental and sensory technologies are pivotal to the requirements to build the project. It is also a requirement to be able to build the necessary hardware (the sensor and receiver if Raspberry Pi alternative is not used). For the software, the engineer must be capable to the extent that he/she can make various reliable databases that can be accessed via the Bluetooth sensor. The most crucial requirement is that the data regarding mental health is reliable and correct, so a reliable consultant is also required for reference.
</div><div>
</div><div>​The outcome or end goal of the project is to efficiently and effectively construct an interface that responds depending on the subject’s mental health. The project is designed to operate without manual user input, hence the sensor technology, as self-diagnosis of mental health conditions is largely unreliable.</div></div>
